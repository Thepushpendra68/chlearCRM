PLEASE DO THIS AND SEND ME A SCREENSHOT:

1. Open the page with the error
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Click "Network" tab
4. Refresh the page (F5)
5. Click on the "accounts?page=1&limit=20" request
6. Take a screenshot showing:
   - The Status Code (top right)
   - The Response tab content
   
OR copy and paste here:

Status Code: [WHAT NUMBER DO YOU SEE?]

Response Body: [COPY THE TEXT FROM THE RESPONSE TAB]

Console Errors: [COPY ANY RED ERRORS FROM CONSOLE TAB]

I CANNOT FIX THIS WITHOUT SEEING THE ACTUAL ERROR RESPONSE.

The "Resource not found" message could mean many different things.
I need to see what the server is actually returning.
